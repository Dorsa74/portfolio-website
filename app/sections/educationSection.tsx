      description:`I learned about signal measurement, processing, and transmission in telecommunications, audio/video, and medical imaging,  
      space technology, and music technology. \newline Thesis: On the cell-to-cell extracellular vesicle transmission within the brain,
      case study: Alzheimer's disease. I mathematically described and numerically simulated (MATLAB) an end-to-end communication model 
      within the brainusing molecular communication methodology.`},

      description:
      `Doing one year of this masterâ€™s program, I learned about power system analysis, energy mar-
      kets, and wind turbine design (mechanical and electrical aspects). I also gained knowledge in
      environmental impact analysis and Life Cycle Assessment`},
